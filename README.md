# Challenges I Faced and How I Solved Them
* One of the main challenges I encountered while creating my portfolio was making sure the navigation links worked correctly. At first, the links did not scroll to the correct sections, and it was frustrating because I wanted the site to feel smooth and professional. I solved this issue by checking my HTML code carefully, making sure that every id matched the href in the navigation bar. Another problem I faced was with the images. Some pictures were too large, looked uneven, and did not fit the layout. To fix this, I used CSS properties like width, height, and border to adjust the size and make them more consistent. I also struggled with the overall layout, as it looked plain at first. By applying CSS styling such as padding, margins, and better color combinations, I made the page cleaner and more attractive. Additionally, one image had an unwanted background person, so I removed it to keep the focus on my work. Another major challenge was logging into my account and connecting my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to GitHub. After researching, I learned how to use Git commands and upload my code properly. These solutions helped me finish my portfolio successfully.

# How I Would Improve the Portfolio Next
* Looking forward, there are several improvements I want to make to my portfolio so that it not only looks better but also functions more effectively. First, I want to make it fully responsive by adding media queries in CSS. This will allow my portfolio to adapt smoothly to different devices like mobile phones and tablets. I also plan to enhance the design by adding animations, hover effects, and a more modern grid-based layout to make the site more engaging. Another important improvement would be adding more content, such as a section for projects, certificates, or even testimonials, to showcase my skills and credibility better. I also want to improve the performance by compressing images and cleaning up unnecessary lines of code to ensure faster loading speed. Another step is to make the portfolio interactive by adding a working contact form and links to my social media accounts for better networking. Since I initially struggled with uploading my files to GitHub, I would like to organize my repository better, write a clear README, and even try using GitHub Pages for free hosting. These improvements would make my portfolio more professional, user-friendly, and impactful.
